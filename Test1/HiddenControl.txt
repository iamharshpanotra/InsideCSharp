The HiddenField control is used to store a value that needs to be persisted across posts to the server, 
but you don't want the control or it's value visible to the user. 
For example, when editing and updaing an employee record, we don't want the user to see the EmployeeId. 
So, we will store the EmployeeId in a HiddenField, so that it can then be used on the server to update 
the correct employees record.
